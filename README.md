# RandomX
RandomX is a proof-of-work (PoW) algorithm optimized for general-purpose CPUs. It uses random code execution (hence the name) combined with several memory-hard techniques to minimize the efficiency advantage of specialized hardware like ASICs.

## Usage
### 🚀 NMiner
The `NMiner` class is used to connect directly to a mining pool and start CPU mining.

### Constructor Overloads
```ts
type mode = "FAST" | "LIGHT";

interface MinerOptions {
    mode?: mode;
    proxy?: string;
    threads?: number;
    logging?: boolean;
}

new NMiner(pool: string, address?: string);
new NMiner(pool: string, options?: MinerOptions);

new NMiner(pool: string, address: string, pass?: string);
new NMiner(pool: string, address: string, options?: MinerOptions);

new NMiner(pool: string, address: string, pass: string, options?: MinerOptions);
```

### 🌐 NMinerProxy
The `NMinerProxy` class runs a local proxy server that routes mining connections to a pool.
It can be used to hide traffic (via WebSocket) or handle miners on sensitive VPS environments.

### Constructor Overloads
```ts
type connection = { pool: string, address?: string, pass?: string };

interface ProxyOptions {
    port?: number;
    proxy?: string;
    logging?: boolean;
    handler?: EventEmitter;
    onShare?: (address: string, target: number, height?: number) => void | Promise<void>;
    onConnection?: (address: string, pass: string, threads: number) => boolean | connection | Promise<boolean | connection>;
}

new NMinerProxy(pool: string, address?: string);
new NMinerProxy(pool: string, options?: ProxyOptions);

new NMinerProxy(pool: string, address: string, pass?: string);
new NMinerProxy(pool: string, address: string, options?: ProxyOptions);

new NMinerProxy(pool: string, address: string, pass: string, options?: ProxyOptions);
```
